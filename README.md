# Factorio Data tester

This tool's purpose is to test Factorio mod(s) validity by loading them as if they are loaded by the actual game, except this is not a game.

More about inner workings and development status can be found in source code comments (for now)

# Development status

Factorio lua is working with `mlua` (`mlua` branch, current development happens there). Trying to get Localised Strings to work (although this is probably not very important but will be goodfor built-in functions functionality).
